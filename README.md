# Android skeleton project

This project forms the basis for a new Android app, with support for Gradle and Android Studio.

It includes sample gradle files and common settings for Proguard, Checkstyle and Findbugs.

You can download a zip file of this repository from the Bitbucket web interface to use the skeleton
as a starting point for new projects.

This project is a work-in-progress and developers are welcome to make suggestions and improvements
to this skeleton project.

README.md Markdown Document
===========================

This is a document that is displayed on the BitBucket Repository page.

You can use the Markdown formatting style to produce this document and make it look pretty.

Examples
====================

## Headers
```
 # Header 1
 ## Header 2
 ### Header 3
 #### Header 4
 ##### Header 5
 ###### Header 6
```

## Styles
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists. List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.

Form bulleted lists with any of * (asterisk), + (plus), or - (dash). You can one or any or mix of these to form a list:

* Red
+ Green
- Blue

```
  * Red
  + Green
  - Blue
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

See [here](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo/overview#markdown-header-code-and-syntax-highlighting) for more information about BitBucket's code highlighting.

## Tables

Bitbucket does not support <html> so you need to use the - (dash) and the | (pipe) symbols to construct a table. The first line contains column headers. Separate columns with the pipe symbol.

The second line must be a mandatory separator line between the headers and the content. Subsequent lines are table rows. Columns are always separated by the pipe (|) character. For example this table:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Comes from
```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

You can only put simple lines in a table.

You can specify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines. A colon at the left of the separator line, left-aligns the column. A colon on the right, right-aligns the column. Add colons to both sides to center the column is center-aligned.

Right     | Left   | Center 
---------:| :----- |:-----:
Computer  |  $1600 | one
Phone     |    $12 | three
Pipe      |     $1 | eleven

Comes from:
```
Right     | Left   | Center 
---------:| :----- |:-----:
Computer  |  $1600 | one
Phone     |    $12 | three
Pipe      |     $1 | eleven
```

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.

> This line is part of the same quote.

```
  > Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.

  > This line is part of the same quote.
```

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
