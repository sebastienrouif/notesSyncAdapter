# Android contacts with sync Adapter

This project shows how top use a sync adapter to push and pull notes from a server.
A push notification could be sent from the server to tell the app that the list of notes has changed.

+ Authenticator is very basic (creates an account at the launch of the app)
+ Content provider has been [generated automatically](https://github.com/BoD/android-contentprovider-generator)
+ SyncAdapter uses a list of tasks to perform in an helper based on [Google I/O app](https://github.com/google/iosched)
+ Connection to the API uses the generated library by google Could endpoint module
+ UI uses a classic master detail flow generated by Android studio

Server side 
+ I used [Google cloud endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/mobile/endpoints/)
